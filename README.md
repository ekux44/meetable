# Meetable
## Peer-to-Peer Scheduling Assistant
=========

Meetable is our entry into the 2012 Compute Midwest Hackathon. We built Meetable to make ad-hoc scheduling with friends and colleagues easy. Meetable works by allowing anyone to create a meeting with their friends. Simply pick a time range and who you want to invite from your contacts. We will send everyone a text message or e-mail to coordinate the time. Meetable does not stop working until a mutual time has been decided on. Once a time has been picked then we will notify everyone. Also, Meetable has the option to send friendly reminders right before the meeting.
